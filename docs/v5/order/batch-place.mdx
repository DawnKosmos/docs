:::tip
This endpoint provides the batch order mode to place a bunch of orders.
- Make sure you have sufficient funds in your account when place an order. Once an order is placed, according to the
funds required by the order, the funds in your account will be frozen by the corresponding amount during the life cycle
of the order.
- The same request can only contain orders of the same contract type, i.e., options and futures cannot be placed at the same
time. Only `Limit` / `Market` active order is supported, the conditional order is not supported.
- If both future and option orders are in one request, then by given the category type, only the orders whose
symbol _matches the category_ will be operated.
- The maximum number of orders included in each request is **10** orders. The returned data list is divided into two lists.
The list created by the order and the created information are returned. The structure of the two lists are completely consistent.
